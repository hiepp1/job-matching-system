LE NGUYEN VIET HIEP is an Intern AI Engineer with 0 years of experience. Their background consists primarily of academic coursework and personal projects related to deep learning, natural language processing, and MLOps. They are currently pursuing a Bachelor in Computer Science and possess an Advanced English proficiency (CEFR B2). Through an internship at NewAI Vietnam, they assisted in internal chatbot development by fine-tuning LLMs for specialized tasks, implemented NLP preprocessing pipelines for Vietnamese text for RAG systems, and coordinated API integration. They have gained academic knowledge of architectures such as CNN, RNN, Transformer, Attention Mechanism, and LLMs, applying techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, MLOps, and NLP preprocessing in various projects.

Technically, they have gained basic exposure to programming languages including Python, Java, and C++, and are familiar with development tools such as GitHub, VSCode, Google Colab, and the Gemini API. They are developing skills in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, along with NLP libraries such as Hugging Face, LangChain, NLTK, and Underthesea through academic and personal projects. Their experience extends to databases like PostgreSQL and DevOps/cloud concepts including Hugging Face Spaces and Git LFS. They have learned about architectures such as DenseNet201 and Encoder-Decoder, and techniques including Semantic vector search (FAISS), Keyword retrieval (BM25), ETL, Sequence padding, Look-ahead masking, Teacher-forcing, Agile, Scrum, and evaluation metrics like SacreBLEU and BLEU, demonstrating a foundational understanding of deep learning, MLOps, and low-code AI integration.
