Pham Tien Dat is an Intern AI Engineer with 0 years of experience. Their background consists primarily of academic coursework and personal projects related to Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). They are currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science in Computer Science and possess C1 English proficiency.

Technically, they have gained basic exposure to Python and are familiar with tools such as GPT-4o. They are developing skills in frameworks like PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and OpenCV, and have learned about architectures such as YOLOv8, LLMs (GPT-4), and SVM. Their academic and personal projects demonstrate exposure to techniques including RAG, hybrid search (vector-based with ChromaDB and keyword-based with Rank BM25), re-ranking, fine-tuning, object detection, multi-object tracking, and deep learning for tasks like poem generation. They also have a basic understanding of traditional machine learning, image processing, and feature extraction.
