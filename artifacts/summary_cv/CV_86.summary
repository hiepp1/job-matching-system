Ngoc Minh Nguyen is an Intern AI Engineer with 0.25 years of experience. Their background consists primarily of academic coursework and personal projects related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. They are currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and possess Advanced English proficiency (CEFR B2).

Technically, they have gained basic exposure to Python and Java, and are familiar with tools such as Git, Docker, and AWS. They are developing skills in AI/ML frameworks like Langchain, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn, and FastAPI, alongside libraries such as Chainlit, Gradio, Langgraph, Unsloth, Cleanlab, OpenCV, and Pandas. Their academic knowledge includes databases like SQLite and MongoDB. Through academic assignments and an internship, they have learned about LLMs (including LLaMA 3, Mistral, Phi-4), Multi-agent systems, RAG, Fine-tuning (QLoRA), Reasoning-driven tool-use, Memory retention, Context-aware conversations, and Image processing pipelines. During their internship, they assisted in designing and implementing an AI-powered website, developing a User Agent and Admin Agent, focusing on end-to-end AI system design and FastAPI backend integration. Their academic projects include a Multimodal Multi-Agent Travel Support Bot leveraging LangGraph and MongoDB, an AI-powered Vietnam Legal Assistant utilizing RAG and fine-tuning LLMs (LLaMA 3, Mistral, Phi-4) with QLoRA via Unsloth, and a vision solution for extracting time from analog clocks using OpenCV. They have also completed certifications in Deep Research with LangGraph and Long-Term Agentic Memory with LangGraph.
