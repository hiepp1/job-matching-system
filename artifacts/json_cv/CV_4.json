Implemented intelligent search for Pacman to eat all food dots and visit four corners, using Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A*. Proposed and analyzed heuristics for A* ensuring admissibility and consistency. Built a console-based visualization of Pacman’s path with actions (North, East, West, South, Stop) and total path cost."
